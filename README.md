# Finding-the-Purposes-for-Insomnia-among-Various-Age-Gatherings-of-Bangladesh.
Purpose: Insomnia  is a sleep disorder that creates trouble in falling asleep, affects millions of peopleâ€™s health, quality of life, work performance worldwide. In this project,I tried to figure out how insomnia is affecting different age groups and the reason behind it. I also wanted to know how people deal with these insomnia problems.

For serving this purposes I took interview of 30 people (16 to 70 years). The data was stored in a Microsoft Excel sheet. For showing the relationships among different factors using graphs I took the help of the Matplotlib library in Python.

I analyzed the collected data. After analyzing  the  data, I found out the causes and severity of insomnia and how these factors affect people of different age groups. I also get insights into how people of various age groups deal with this problem.
